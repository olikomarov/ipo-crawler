Through our wholly owned bank subsidiary, Metropolitan Commercial Bank, we provide a broad range of business, commercial and retail banking products and services to small businesses, middle-market enterprises, public entities and affluent individuals in the New York metropolitan area. Our founding members, including our Chief Executive Officer Mark DeFazio, recognized a need in the New York metropolitan area for a solutions-oriented relationship bank focused on middle-market companies and real estate entrepreneurs who require loans of $2 millionâ€“$20 million, a size often overlooked or de-prioritized by larger financial institutions. Metropolitan Commercial Bank was established in 1999 with the goal of helping these underserved clients build and sustain wealth."}
