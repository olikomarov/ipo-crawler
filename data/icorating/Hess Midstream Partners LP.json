In mid-2015, Hess contributed certain of its existing midstream assets in the Bakken to Hess Infrastructure Partners, a midstream energy joint venture in which GIP purchased a 50% ownership interest for approximately $2.675 billion, representing an aggregate value for Hess Infrastructure Partners of approximately $5.35 billion. Hess Infrastructure Partners will contribute all of our initial assets to us at or prior to the closing of this offering. Our initial assets are primarily located in the Bakken and Three Forks Shale plays in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota, which we refer to collectively as the Bakken, one of the most prolific crude oil producing basins in North America."}
