Our mission is to help our customers protect and connect to what matters mostâ€”their families, homes, and businesses. The ADT brand is synonymous with security and, as the most recognized and trusted brand in the industry, is a key driver of our success. A 2017 survey found that the ADT brand had approximately 95% brand awareness, and nearly half of ADT customers surveyed did not consider any other security alarm provider during their purchase process. We estimate that we are approximately five times larger than the next largest residential competitor, with an approximate 30% market share of the residential monitored security industry in the United States and Canada."}
