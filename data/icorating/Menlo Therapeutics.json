There are currently no therapies approved in the United States that are primarily intended to reduce the pruritus associated with these conditions. We are concurrently evaluating the use of serlopitant for the treatment of refractory chronic cough, a cough that persists for greater than eight weeks despite treatment of any identified underlying cause. There are currently no drugs specifically approved for refractory chronic cough in the United States. These indications each represent a significant patient need. We believe that serlopitant, a highly selective, once‑daily, oral small molecule inhibitor of the neurokinin 1 receptor, or NK1‑R, has the potential to significantly alleviate pruritus and refractory chronic cough symptoms."}
