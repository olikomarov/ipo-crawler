The Pure-Vu system has been designed to integrate with standard colonoscopes to enable cleaning during the procedure while preserving standard procedural workflow and techniques. Our Pure-Vu system and the procedure to cleanse the colon in preparation for colonoscopy are not currently reimbursable through private or governmental third-party payors in any country, but we intend to seek reimbursement through private or governmental third-party payors in the future."}
