Neurodegeneration represents one of the most significant unmet medical needs of our time, with few effective therapeutic options available for patients with Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, and other neurodegenerative diseases. The burden of these diseases to patients and society is massive. We believe the time is right to make a strong and ambitious effort to defeat neurodegeneration. We believe that we can succeed in a field that has seen limited success in the past, because of our team of experienced and passionately dedicated scientists and drug developers, our focused scientific strategy, and our proprietary blood-brain barrier, or BBB, platform delivery technology. We are developing a broad portfolio of targeted therapeutic candidates for neurodegenerative diseases and have recently initiated our first clinical trials."}
