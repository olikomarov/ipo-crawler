We have pioneered an agentless approach to network security to protect organizations against the emerging threats that exploit the billions of Internet of Things, or IoT, devices connected to organizationsâ€™ networks. Over 28 billion devices will be connected to the internet by the year 2020, according to ABI Research, and a growing percentage of them will be used for business purposes through Bring Your Own Device, or BYOD, and Enterprise IoT initiatives. According to the 2017 Strategic Roadmap for IoT Network Technology by Gartner (January 2017), 63 million IoT devices will be attempting to connect to the enterprise network each second by 2020."}
