Specifically, we target well-characterized biological pathways with significant scientific data supporting their importance in regulating the immune response against cancer and for which either there are no molecules in development or those that exist have suboptimal profiles. To exploit these pathways, we have built a robust and highly efficient discovery capability to create and optimize highly differentiated small-molecule immuno-oncology product candidates."}
