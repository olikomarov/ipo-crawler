We define middle market CRE as commercial properties that have values up to $75.0 million and transitional CRE as commercial properties subject to redevelopment or repositioning activities that are expected to increase the value of the properties. We believe that focusing on middle market and transitional CRE will provide us with opportunities to achieve higher returns relative to first mortgage loans secured by properties that have values greater than $75.0 million or stabilized properties."}
