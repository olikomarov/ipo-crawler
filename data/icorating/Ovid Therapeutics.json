We believe these disorders represent an attractive area for drug development as the understanding of the underlying biology has grown meaningfully over the last few years; yet has remained underappreciated by the industry. Our experienced team began with a vision to integrate the biology and symptomology of rare neurological conditions to employ innovative research and clinical strategies for the development of our drug candidates."}
