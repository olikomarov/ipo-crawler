Our product candidates are small molecules based on two distinct mechanistic platforms—calcitonin gene-related peptide, or CGRP, receptor antagonists and glutamate modulators—which we believe have the potential to significantly alter existing treatment approaches across a diverse set of neurological indications with high unmet need in both large markets and orphan indications."}
