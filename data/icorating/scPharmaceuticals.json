Our proprietary platform is designed to enable the subcutaneous administration of therapies that have previously been limited to intravenous, or IV, delivery. By moving delivery away from the high-cost healthcare settings typically required for IV administration, we believe our technology reduces overall healthcare costs and advances the quality and convenience of care. Our lead product candidate, Furoscix, consists of our patented subcutaneous formulation of furosemide delivered via our sc2Wear Infusor and is under development for treatment of worsening, or decompensated, heart failure outside of the inpatient setting. We filed a new drug application, or NDA, for Furoscix, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in August 2017."}
