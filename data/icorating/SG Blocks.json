SGB takes existing steel shipping containers and repurposes them into modules that can be stacked, arranged, or configured to fit any construction application. The use of these repurposed shipping containers, which we refer to as “SG BlocksTM,” allows owners design flexibility and greater construction efficiency than traditional methods of construction. SG BlocksTM also have a particular application in meeting safe and sustainable housing needs, especially in hurricane- and earthquake-prone areas."}
