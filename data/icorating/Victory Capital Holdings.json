Our differentiated model features a scalable operating platform that provides centralized distribution, marketing and operations infrastructure to our Franchises and solutions platform. As of September 30, 2017, our Franchises and our solutions platform collectively managed a diversified set of 70 investment strategies for a wide range of institutional and retail clients. Our Franchises are operationally integrated, but are separately branded and make investment decisions independently from one another within guidelines established by their respective investment mandates. Our integrated multi-boutique model creates a supportive environment in which our investment professionals, largely unencumbered by administrative and operational responsibilities, can focus on their pursuit of investment excellence. VCM employs all of our U.S. investment professionals across our Franchises, which are not separate legal entities."}
