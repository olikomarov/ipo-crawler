Within the major shale plays in the United States, we believe we are a market leader in sourcing and transfer of water (both by permanent pipeline and temporary pipe) prior to its use in drilling and completion activities associated with hydraulic fracturing or “fracking,” which we collectively refer to as “pre-frac water services.” In most of our areas of operations, we provide complementary water-related services that support oil and gas well completion and production activities including containment, monitoring, treatment, flowback, hauling and disposal."}
