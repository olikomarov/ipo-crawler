We believe that the economic recovery of Argentina represents one of the most attractive opportunities in global emerging markets today. Cement consumption is highly correlated to economic activity and we expect demand for cement to grow significantly within the next five years in Argentina. After two decades of capital scarcity across the industry, installed cement production capacity in the country is reaching its limit and we believe that Argentina will soon face a structural cement supply deficit."}
