Our growth has been driven by two key factors: (i) a significant increase in the number of pet owners and in the size of the pet food market in China which translated into expansion opportunities for us, and (ii) a fundamental change in Chinese society towards pets, pet ownership and care, such that the trends of pet humanization and consumer concerns for pet health and wellness have created a dynamically growing industry for pet food and products."}
