In the future, we intend to develop into the best and most comprehensive online platform offering upscale products and services. We offer an integrated online and offline shopping platform, which consists of our Secoo.com website, mobile applications and offline experience centers. Our online platform facilitates easy product selection, order processing and convenient payment methods, such as our Secoo Check, which allows customers to make payments for our merchandise products in installments on our online platform directly.
