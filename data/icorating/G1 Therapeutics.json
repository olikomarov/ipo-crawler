Our two clinical assets are based on our core understanding of cyclin-dependent kinases, or CDKs, a family of proteins that play an important role in the growth and proliferation of all human cells. Two particular CDKs, CDK4 and CDK6, collectively known as CDK4/6, represent a validated and promising class of targets for anti-cancer therapeutics."}
