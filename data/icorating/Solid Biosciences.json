DMD is a progressive, irreversible and ultimately fatal disease that affects about one in every 3,500 to 5,000 live male births and has an estimated prevalence of 10,000 to 15,000 cases in the United States alone.Â DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which result in the absence or near absence of dystrophin protein. Dystrophin protein works to strengthen muscle fibers and protect them from daily wear and tear. Our lead product candidate is a gene-transfer candidate."}
