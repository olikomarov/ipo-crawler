We offer a broad portfolio of products to diverse replacement channel customers, and to original equipment manufacturers as specified components, with the majority of our revenue coming from replacement channels. Our products are used in applications across numerous end markets, which include construction, agriculture, energy, automotive, transportation, general industrial, consumer products and many others. Our revenue has historically been highly correlated with industrial activity and utilization, and not with any single end market given the diversification of our business and high exposure to replacement markets."}
