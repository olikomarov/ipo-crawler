We are focused on metabolic disorders that result in excess accumulation of certain metabolites, such as oxalate and urate, that can cause kidney stones, damage the kidney, and potentially lead to chronic kidney disease, or CKD, and end-stage renal disease. Our proprietary technological approach enables us to design and develop stable, non-absorbable oral enzyme therapies that remain in the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract, where the enzyme can degrade these metabolites, allowing for removal from the body through the bowel."}
