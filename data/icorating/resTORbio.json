Our lead program has demonstrated in several clinical trials, including a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, the potential to treat multiple diseases of aging for which there are no approved therapies. The decline in immune function that occurs during aging, or immunosenescence, increases susceptibility to a variety of diseases, including respiratory tract infections, or RTIs, that significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality in the elderly."}
