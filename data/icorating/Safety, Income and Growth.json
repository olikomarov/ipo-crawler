GNLs generally represent ownership of the land underlying commercial real estate projects that is net leased by the fee owner of the land to the owners/operators of the real estate projects built thereon. GNLs are typically “triple net” leases, meaning that the tenant is responsible for development costs, capital expenditures and all property operating expenses, such as maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. GNLs are typically long-term (base terms ranging from 30 to 99 years, often with tenant renewal options) and have contractual base rent increases (either at a specified percentage or CPI-based, or both) and sometimes include percentage rent participations."}
