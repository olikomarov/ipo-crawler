We believe that our monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, offer a novel approach to address serious infections. Unlike antibiotics that propagate resistance, disrupt both disease-causing and beneficial bacteria and have adverse off-target effects, mAbs have the ability to precisely bind only to the intended target, thereby avoiding these undesired consequences. Our lead product candidate, ASN100, is a first-in-class mAb therapeutic in Phase 2 clinical development for the prevention of Staphylococcus aureus, or S.Â aureus, pneumonia in high-risk, mechanically ventilated patients, a potentially life-threatening and costly infection for which there are no approved preventive therapies. In addition to ASN100, our preclinical pipeline is comprised of mAbs targeting multiple serious bacterial and viral pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV."}
