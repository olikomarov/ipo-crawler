We define GSEA as the combined region of Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. This region had 585.3 million people and GDP of US$3.0 trillion in 2016, according to the IMF Outlook. It is also one of the world’s fastest growing regions in terms of per capita GDP and at the early stages of internet penetration. GSEA’s markets are increasingly interdependent, particularly for internet business models."}
